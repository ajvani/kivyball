#kivyball
Wanted to practice my python/kivy skills. Made a simple basketball game. 

#Setup
1. Clone repository
2. Run ```$ npm install ``` 
3. Run ```$ python main.py ```

#Notes
- Still has a few bugs in place
- Works best in a square window

#Upcoming
- Make ball movement more realistic (Bounces/shooting)
- Add a guideline to show where you're shooting

##Known Bugs to fix
- You can change the ball's movement path while it's already moving (FIXED)
- Bouncing off the rim is a little funky
- If the ball is shot right under the backboard it actually bounces back to starting position (FIXED)
